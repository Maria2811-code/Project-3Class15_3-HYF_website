## The Mission
This is our attempt to reverse engineering [Hack Your Future.be](https://hackyourfuture.be/). It is our second group project in order to learn the next subjects:

- __Incremental Development__ working a single remote Repo, from each group member's laptop.
- __Agile__ methodology is the way we work, adding small steps and performing regular meetings to learn from each other: 
  - This also help us to understand GitHub features as a tool to manage a group project.
  - It is our first aproaching into work through CLI
  - The importance of a well done Development Strategy and the whole plannification process.

### The Technology  

- __HTML & CSS__ to buit the whole website.
- __Git & GitHub__ for managing the versions and store the repo.
- __DevTools__ for inspecting the real website and understanding the flow.
- __Visual Studio Code__ and all the useful extensions for make our lives easiest.
