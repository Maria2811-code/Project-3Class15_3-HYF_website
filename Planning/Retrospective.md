## Retrospective

The group will summarize your work by providing answers to these three questions. We can have more than one answer! 
- **Stop Doing**:   
  - Having meetings with no plan to do, and without a time settled.

- **Continue Doing**:   
  - Keep daily **communication** with the whole team. We can delegate someone for this matter. 

  - Help our team mates to improve technical skills.
- **Start Doing**:  
  - Assign task directly to one or two members per task.
  - Set a reasonable deadline for each task.
  - Commit ourselves to learn and study and practice more or at least the 30 hours recommended by HYF.
- **Lessons Learned**: what cool things or general lessons has your team learned? This can be about anything, not just code!  

  - Working as a group and teach and learn together at the same time.
  - Implement Agile strategy without really knowing that we were doing it.
